Identify this country along with the following information:<br/>
1. The infant mortality rate<br/>
2. The percent of literacy in the population broken down by Total and gender.<br/>
3. Current or recent events that may have led to hunger.<p/>

<strong>Clue:</strong> The colonial boundaries created by Britain to delimit this country grouped together a wide range of ethnic groups with different political systems and cultures. These differences prevented the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100,000 lives. <p/>
