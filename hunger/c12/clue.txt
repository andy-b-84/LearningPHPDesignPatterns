<strong>Clue:</strong> This country, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern parts of the country, which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and the rebels.<p/>
