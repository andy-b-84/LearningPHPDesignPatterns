Identify this country along with the following information:<br/>
1. The infant mortality rate<br/>
2. The percent of literacy in the population broken down by Total and gender.<br/>
3. Current or recent events that may have led to hunger.<p/>

<strong>Clue:</strong>  The poorest country in the region, this country has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations. Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but this country finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006.<p/>
